          <h1 class="text-center header"> Browser Wars</h1>
          <p class="text-center p ">A browser war is competition for dominance in the usage share of web browsers. The "First Browser War" during the late 1990s pitted Microsoft's Internet Explorer against Netscape's Navigator. Browser wars continued with the decline of Internet Explorer's market share and the popularity of other browsers including Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera.
                With the introduction of HTML5 and CSS 3, a new generation of browser war began, this time adding extensive client-side scripting to the World Wide Web, as well as more widespread use of smartphones and other mobile devices for browsing the web. These newcomers have ensured that browser battles continue among enthusiasts, while the average web user is less affected.</p><br><br>

                <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-6"> <p class="p">By mid-1995 the most popular web browser was Netscape Navigator and when Microsoft’s browser appeared, Navigator had a market share of around 85%. 
                                Although Windows users had to buy Internet Explorer 1.0 as part of the Windows 95 Plus! pack, subsequent versions were made available as a free download, while Netscape Navigator cost $49. In short, Microsoft was giving away Internet Explorer to gain market share — something no other company could afford to do at the time.
                                Microsoft’s tactical superiority over the competition — it also made the most popular computer operating system in the world — also meant it could ‘persuade’ PC manufacturers to include Internet Explorer with their new models instead of Netscape Navigator. </p></div>
                       
                        <div class="col-md-6"> <p class="p" >That meant almost every new PC had an Internet Explorer icon on the Desktop as soon as it was switched on — and that meant users didn’t have to worry about downloading anything else.Netscape’s fortunes soon started to dwindle and, by the time Internet Explorer 5.0 appeared in 1999, the by-then slow and buggy Netscape Navigator was all but dead. 
                                The first browser war ended with Internet Explorer having no remaining serious competition for its market share. This also brought an end to the rapid innovation in web browsers; until 2006 there was only one new version of Internet Explorer since version 6.0 had been released in 2001.

                    <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-6"> <p class="p">Netscape Navigator was still around by this point, but it was no longer a force to be reckoned with. However, its source code had long since been released as open source and Mozilla 1.0 was launched in 2002. Over 90 percent of web users were with Internet Explorer by now, but since not everyone was happy with Internet Explorer, some started to switch to this alternative.
                            Mozilla soon evolved into the Phoenix web browser, which was then renamed to Firebird and then, in 2004, renamed again to Firefox. Since it was open source software, Mozilla (in all its forms) was free to download and use and a little-known commercial browser called Opera also became free around this time. </p></div>
                   
                    <div class="col-md-6"> <p class="p" >By the time Microsoft released Internet Explorer 7 in 2006, it was playing catch up to features already found in the increasingly popular Firefox (as it was then known) and Opera, and uptake was slow. Google raised the bar still higher in 2008 with its super-fast Chrome browser and it quickly found favour, gaining a 3.6 percent market share in little under a year.
                            But it was Firefox that was winning fans the fastest. By 2009, one report reckoned that it was the most popular web browser worldwide, when compared to individual versions of other browsers. In other words, while Internet Explorer was still by far the most popular web browser, Microsoft appeared to be losing the war.</p></div>

The browser wars are still going strong and fragmentation is a more prevalent issue than ever due to the frequent updates and releases of different browser versions and operating systems.
                                Browsers preferences are also largely dependant on demographics including age, country, and even job. For example, many schools and companies have certain requirements about what devices, operating systems, and browsers users may access and don’t permit individuals to update on their own.
                                Additionally,

                        <div class="col-md-6"> <p class="p" >as browsers continually update versions hoping to be the next Google Chrome, there’s no saying when one will finally surpass its popularity or when another company creates their own browser to enter the mix. In fact, with Firefox’s recent Quantum version, more and more users and considering making the switch in favor of a faster browsing experience.
                                Not to mention, the underdog browsers still capture a distinct user base. While something like UC Browser might not capture a large percentage of the internet in comparison to the big five, it still serves about 500 million people.</p></div>
